## What is Web Accessibility?
- Making the web accessible for the *widest possible audience*
- This audience includes temporarily able-bodied users (TABs)
- Currently, online infrastructure is *hostile* to those with disabilities
- Inseparable from SEO, mobile and usability: improve one and you improve the others
- **Adherence to standards** - best way to accomplish accessibility.

### W3C WCAG 2.0
- W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are principle-based, not technology-based.
- The four principles (**POUR**)
  - Perceivable
  - Operable
  - Understandable
  - Robust

### Validating site 
- Why site should be validated?
  - Browsers are the helicopter parents of programming
  - As your pages become more complex "hidden" areas can be devastating

### Three approaches
1. Validate by URI
2. Validate by Filename
3. Valdiate by Direct Input

### Accessibility Validation
- You can use wave.webaim.org to validate accessibility
- You can install an extension to check local pages

## Hosting site
- Requirements:
  - Domain name
  - Hosting company
  
### Domain names
- Typically purchased for multiple years at cheap related
- Most common is .com, but other extensions are gaining acceptance
- *Domain names are useless on their own*

### Hosting
- What is your URL right now?
- You need a registered IP Address to connect with your domain name
- Hosting services vary
  - Free 
  - Mid-range
  - Full-service

### Free Services 
- Little/no control of domain name
- Limited tools
- Advertising and redirects
- Familiar look and feel across them

### Paid services
- Tend to have better tools
- Support is available
- But check for free services through work/school
